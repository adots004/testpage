    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>My mission goes beyond simply solving homework problems. Whether you're struggling to grasp fundamental concepts or seeking problem-solving strategies, 
      my tutoring service offers personalized support at every stage of your academic path. I provide two core types of support:
    </p>
     <ul>
        <li><b>Targeted Homework Assistance:</b> Rather than simply giving answers to homework sets, I offer strategic hints and targeted explanations to help you overcome challenging problems. 
            My approach focuses on developing your problem-solving skills, breaking down questions into manageable steps, and helping you build the analytical reasoning needed to arrive at solutions independently. 
            This method ensures you not only complete assignments but truly understand the underlying concepts.
            <br><br>
            <b style="color:blue;">Pro Tip:</b> The more clearly you can communicate your challenges, the more effectively I can help. Before our session, try to:
            <ul>
                <li>Identify exactly where you're getting stuck</li>
                <li>Highlight specific concepts / types of questions you find unclear</li>
                <li>Prepare any prior attempts or approaches you've already tried</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Supplemental Instruction:</b> Learning physics and mathematics requires more than passive reading—it demands active, personalized engagement. I craft dynamic learning experiences that adapt to your unique academic needs, going far beyond traditional tutoring. This comprehensive approach includes carefully crafted lesson plans, in-depth concept breakdowns, and personalized recorded video lectures that go beyond traditional coursework. Whether you need to fill knowledge gaps or gain a deeper understanding of complex topics, my supplemental instruction is designed to support your learning journey. I offer flexible instruction formats—live interactive Zoom sessions for real-time engagement or asynchronous pre-recorded lectures that allow you to review challenging concepts at your own pace and convenience.
            <br><br>
            <b style="color:blue;">Pro Tip:</b> Maximize our instruction time by preparing in advance. Consider:
            <ul>
                <li>Providing a detailed overview of your current understanding</li>
                <li>Listing specific topics or chapters you want to focus on</li>
                <li>Gathering relevant course materials or textbook references</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>My approach recognizes that learning is not one-size-fits-all. Some students need to reconstruct their understanding from the ground up, while others require focused help with specific challenges. 
      I'm committed to meeting you exactly where you are in your educational journey, providing the support you need to excel in physics and mathematics.</p>
