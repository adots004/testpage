    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>My mission goes beyond simply solving homework problems. I understand that academic success in physics and mathematics requires a comprehensive approach tailored to each undergraduate student's
      unique learning journey. Whether you're struggling to grasp fundamental concepts or seeking advanced problem-solving strategies, 
      my tutoring service offers personalized support at every stage of your academic path. I provide two core types of support:</p>
<li>Supplemental Instruction: Helping you build a solid foundation by breaking down complex topics, filling knowledge gaps, and developing a deeper understanding of core principles.</li>
<li>Targeted Homework Assistance: Guiding you through problem-solving techniques, helping you understand the underlying reasoning, and developing your analytical skills.</li>
<p>My approach recognizes that learning is not one-size-fits-all. Some students need to reconstruct their understanding from the ground up, while others require focused help with specific challenges. 
  I'm committed to meeting you exactly where you are in your educational journey, providing the support you need to excel in physics and mathematics.</p>
