            <h3>Supplemental Instruction</h3> 
            <p>I create customized learning resources tailored to your specific academic needs. 
                This includes comprehensive lesson plans and personalized recorded video lectures that complement traditional coursework, allowing you to review complex concepts at your own pace. 
                SI instruction is available in live (zoom) or asynchonous (pre-recorded) format.

            <h3>Homework Help</h3> 
            <p>I provide thoughtful homework guidance that respects academic integrity. 
                Rather than providing answers, I offer strategic hints and explanations to help you overcome roadblocks, ensuring you develop the understanding needed to arrive at solutions independently.
